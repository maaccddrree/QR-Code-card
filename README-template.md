## Overview

### Screenshot -->

<!-- ![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above. -->

<!-- **Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.** -->

### What I learned

It was a nice small project to recap my HMTL and CSS knowledge, and drill some code building and using custom properties, flexbox, css grid. It was very fun building this project and looking to do more and more.

<!-- To see how you can add code snippets, see below: -->

<!-- ```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
``` -->

### Continued development

Learning from this project was amazing but I still want to expand my knowledge and have a very strong understanding of flexbox and working with moving elements comfortably. I also want to be a fast coder where it becomes a second nature to me.
